### Layout 
Your customer requested to build a computer database application. He owns about 500+ computers made by different manufacturers (companies such as Apple, Acer, Asus...).
Ideally, each computer would contain the following: a name, the date when it was introduced, eventually the date when it was discontinued, and the manufacturer. Obviously, for some reasons, the existing data is incomplete, and he requested that only the name should remain mandatory when adding a computer, the other fields being filled when possible. Furthermore, the date it was discontinued must be greater than the one he was introduced. The list of computers can be modified, meaning your customer should be able to list, add, delete, and update computers. The list of computers should also be pageable.
The list of companies should be exhaustive, and therefore will not require any update, deletion etc...
